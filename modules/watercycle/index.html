Responsive teaching places different demands on teachers relative to other instructional approaches, and few examples of responsive teaching are available to the education community. To address these needs, several examples of responsive teaching and related teacher discussions are presented in this area of the website. Most include questions to facilitate professional development discussions. Once in the swing of things, users may think of other pertinent questions. Following up on those questions would be the responsive thing to do!

<a name="sequence" id="sequence"></a>Although working alone could be fruitful, working with a partner or in a group will provide structure for carefully considering each study. We suggest working through the sections in the following order:</p>

<table width="93%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="6" align="center">
  <tr valign="top">
    <td width="35%"  align="left">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="using_cs.html">Discussing Case Studies</a>
    </td>
    <td>This section is an important prelude to viewing and discussing the case studies.  Don't skip it!</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td align="left">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="../../toytops.html">Productive Student Ideas</a></td>
    <td>How to identify and follow up on productive student ideas is also an important prelude.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td align="left">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="../pd/smallcase.html">Small Case Studies</a></td>
    <td>Work through a couple of the small case studies in the order presented. Return to the remainder later.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td align="left">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="bonnie/trajectory.html">An Extended Case Study</a></td>
    <td>Get an overview and work partway through. Return to the remainder later.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td align="left">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="../pd/discussions.html">Teacher Discussions</a></td>
    <td>Work through a couple of the teacher discussions in the order presented. Return to the remainder later.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>If you are short on time, work through the top three sections and approach the remainder at a later date.  Working with a dozen teachers, we would spend a 2 to 3 hour session on <em>Discussing the Case Studies</em> and <em>Productive Student Ideas</em>.  We would spend another 2 to 3 hour session on a couple of the <em>Small Case Studies</em>.</p>
