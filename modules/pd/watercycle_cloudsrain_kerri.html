<p>
When responsively teaching the water cycle, students frequently want to discuss clouds and rain.  However, the discussions can vary widely depending on the ideas and questions students contribute.  As examples, two different discussions are presented as small case studies in this section of our website: one from Kerri's class and one from  <a href="watercycle_cloudsrain_chris.html">Chris's class</a>.
</p>
<p>
Kerri's class discussion occurred during the first science lesson of a new school year. This spontaneous dialogue was an offshoot of a larger discussion about the launching question, <em>What happens to the puddle?</em> One of Kerri's students suggested that a cloud is like a giant bowl. About seven minutes later another student, Anthony, suggested that a cloud is like a rubber band. A lively dialog ensued that lasted almost twelve minutes. Below are snippets of that discussion.
</p>
<p>
Things to look for in the video include the students' ideas,   reasoning and  models, and how they interact with one another. Things to note about the teacher's behavior include her demeanor, and her actions and strategies for encouraging and facilitating the discussion.  You might want to watch the videos more than once to help you get a good feel for the students' ideas. You may also want to view the  <a href="watercycle_cloudsrain_kerri.html#" onclick="window.open('movies/Kerri_HowCloudsRain_transcipt.pdf','_blank','height=600,width=700,scrollbars=1');return false;">transcripts</a> or print them for reference and taking notes. As you examine the videos, cite line numbers from the transcripts as evidence for your claims.

<h2 class="greenFont">Video 1</h2>
<p>
As this video begins, Anthony proposes that a cloud is like a rubber band.  Watch how Madeline and Michelle react to Anthony's model.  Note Kerri's responses to the students.
</p>

</p>
<p>
<span class="liteBlue">Examining the video</span>. How do Madeline and Michelle interpret and respond to Anthony's model?  Do the three students seem to have the same understanding of what is a model?  How does Kerri support the students' modeling?  
<br />&nbsp;
</p>

<h2 class="greenFont">Video 2</h2>
<p>
More cloud models are suggested in the next video, then Jonathan spots a weakness in the models proposed thus far.  Towards the end of this segment, the discussion returns to Anthony's rubber band model.
</p>

</p>
<p>
<span class="liteBlue">Examining the video</span>. What other models are suggested?  How are the models related to each other and/or related to the students' experiences?  How does this relate to the practice of scientists?
</p>
<p>
What is the weakness in the model(s) that Jonathan spots? How does he go about addressing it?  
</p>
<p>
In lines 120 to 121 of the transcript Anthony revisits his model.  What does this piece of dialogue indicate about Anthony's beliefs about models?
</p>
<p>
Michelle and Anthony return to his rubber band model in lines 144 to 151.  What might be at the root of Michelle's dissatisfaction with the rubber band model?   
</p>
<p>
In line 148 Anthony says, "No, it was really round."  How does that connect with his rubber band model?
</p>
<p>
What roles do the students and Kerri have in this conversation?  What does this conversation say about students' beliefs about what the class is doing now?  How is this conversation aligned with scientific practices?
</p>
<p>
<span class="liteBlue">Delving deeper</span>. The teachers participating in this project met biweekly to discuss ideas in their classrooms, how to proceed with their students, and other topics pertinent to becoming responsive teachers.  In one meeting they discussed the video presented on this page.  <a href="watercycle_cloudsrain_kerri.html#" onclick="window.open('watercycle_cloudsrain_kerri_delving_v2.html','delving','height=600,width=700,scrollbars=1');return false;">Click here</a> to see some of their discussion.

<h2 class="greenFont">Video 3</h2>
<p>
In the following video Anthony, Chanel and Jonathan discuss a different model for a cloud.  This one is based on a bubble.
</p>
 <p align="center">
<video id="kerri_c3" class="video-js vjs-default-skin"
  controls preload="auto" width="600" height="442"
  poster="movies/Kerri_HowCloudsRain_clip3.png"
  data-setup='{"example_option":true}'>
 <source src="movies/Kerri_HowCloudsRain_clip3.mp4" type='video/mp4' />
 </video>
</p>
<p>
<span class="liteBlue">Examining the video</span>. What criteria do the students use to help them decide if the bubble model is a good one?  How does Kerri's question to Anthony support and facilitate discussion of Anthony's bubble model?  How do the students build off of Anthony's bubble suggestion?
</p>
 <p>
In lines 192 to 194, Chanel reflects on her overflowing cup model that she proposed earlier, and <!--inserted begin-->tries to reconcile it with<!--inserted end--> the latest model based on a bubble.  What seems to be her reasoning?
</p>
 <p>
In any of these videos, are students' ideas the beginnings of scientific thinking?  Review <a href="../../toytops.html">Productive Student Ideas</a> for help with this.  What are some next moves Kerri could make to be responsive to the students, and what would be the corresponding rationale?
 
<p>
<span class="liteBlue">Delving deeper</span>. The teachers participating in this project brainstormed what Kerri could do next that would be responsive to her students' ideas.  In our project we call these <em>next moves</em>.  <a href="watercycle_cloudsrain_kerri.html#" onclick="window.open('watercycle_cloudsrain_kerri_delving_v3.html','delving','height=600,width=700,scrollbars=1');return false;">Click here</a> to see some of their discussion.
