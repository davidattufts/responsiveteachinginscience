Responsive strategies is always one of the hot topics when the teachers meet.  We have found that the most effective way for teachers to share their strategies is within the context of how the strategy has been used, so rather than just listing tips, we ask teachers to flesh out their strategies through examples.

<span class="liteBlue"><strong>Exit slips</strong></span> <br />
Most of our teachers use their notes for reviewing class discussions and making decisions about what to do in the next session.  However, Kerri has been able to watch the videos of her students between science times.  After watching her first day of exploring the water cycle, Kerri sensed that many students still had lots more to say.  However, she wasn't sure that all of her students had been attending to the discussion.  Kerri mentioned this earlier in the meeting, and, as the video segment below begins, Bonnie wanted to go back to this topic.

</video>
<br /><span style="font-size:90%">Video 1</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="liteBlue">Reflecting on the video.</span>
In lines 11 and 18 of the transcript, Kerri mentions behaviors and having conversations with her students to prep them for the water cycle exploration.  What conversations would be important to have with students to prepare them for participating and learning in a responsive learning environment?  
</p>
<p>
Kerri used exit slips to give her information about students' ideas.  What would be some good exit slip questions?  What other strategies could provide information about the ideas in the classroom and inform the teachers decision on what to do next?

<span class="liteBlue"><strong>Next moves when there are several ideas</strong></span> <br />
In our experience, teachers are invariably surprised at how much their students have to contribute to science discussions!  The students have incredibly rich thoughts and conversations to bring to the science table.  In the next video clip, the teachers talk about how to share these ideas, and what to do when there are several viable ideas being kicked around by the students.

In this segment, what strategies are suggested for moving a class forward in an exploration?  How do these strategies align with how scientists move science forward?
