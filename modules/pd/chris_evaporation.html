Whether the ocean evaporates was a popular question that came up in many classrooms.  In this case study we present some debate on this issue that occurred primarily between two students over two class sessions.
</p>
<p>
Chris's class had been discussing how water gets from a puddle to a cloud.  Prior to the first video, one student in Chris's class suggested that clouds somehow vacuum up the water.  Daniel disagrees. (Note: Sandra is the student identified as &quot;Girl&quot; in the captions in the clip below.)

Two days later, Sandra talks about the role of heat in evaporation:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquoteIndent">
<em >I don't think heat is required, because water should I think evaporate whether it's in shade or not. Because, or it should sink into the sidewalk, which I don't think is happening here. But I don't think heat is required, because eventually something will happen to it. Eventually it'll just disappear, or it'll start just fading, or it evaporates, I don't think heat is required.</em>
  </blockquote>
<p>
Soon after Chris repeats the puddle question and Daniel again brings up the ocean.

<span class="liteBlue">Examining the video</span>. Before moving on, spend some time examining the video and transcripts. What are some of the ideas that the students are proposing? Are their ideas based on evidence?  Reasoning? What moves does Chris make that are responsive to the students' discussion? What rationales could he have for his moves?  After some initial examination, <a href="chris_evaporation.html#" onclick="window.open('chris_evaporation_analysis.html','_blank','height=600,width=700,scrollbars=1');return false;">click here</a> to delve deeper.

During a teachers' meeting with other responsive teachers, Chris mentioned his students' ideas about ocean evaporation.  Below is the ensuing discussion.
