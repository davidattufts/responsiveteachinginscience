<h2>Summary</h2>	
<p>On Day 3, <a href="../../../../teachers/sharon.html">Sharon</a> projected students' ideas on the front screen and asked them to group the ideas into categories.  To help students understand the task, she had them first work with a familiar example.   Then, as a whole class and in small groups, the students worked on categorizing ideas on a list they had developed the previous day.  Sharon had made copies of these ideas and distributed them to the groups.  Each group then cut up the ideas on the list and organized them according to criteria of their own choosing.  Sharon collected the ideas, and the next day went over them with the whole class.  Afterwards, the students talked about what they wanted to find more about regarding making a toy car move, and Sharon said they were ready to begin exploring their ideas with actual toy cars.</p>
&nbsp;<br />
<h2>Video Clips</h2>	
<p>Sharon begins Day 3 by projecting some of the ideas students mentioned the previous period about how to get the car move:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Push it with your tongue</li>
  <li> Let it go down a ramp  </li>
  <li>Use a python  </li>
  <li>Put firecrackers on it and shoot it like a rocket  </li>
  <li>Tie a string and pull it  </li>
  <li>Put a fan in front of car, turn it on and the car will go  </li>
  <li>Pull the car back lots of times and then let it go&mdash;it will go by itself  </li>
  <li>Drop the car  </li>
  <li>Shoot it with a rubber band  </li>
  <li>Push it down a ramp and it will have enough energy to make it back up the ramp  </li>
  <li>Use a power boaster  </li>
  <li>Lower it with your mouth  </li>
  <li>Let it fall down a hill  </li>
  <li>A train can push it</li>
  <li> Use a remote control </li>
</ul>
<p>Sharon wanted students to put this list of ideas into groups. To prepare them, she first showed a list of items of everyday objects and activities:  dog, apple, jump rope, carrot, soccer, lizard, goldfish, hopscotch, pizza, tomato, wall ball, and alligator.  She asked class to think about what kind of groups you could put these items into, and what names you could give to the groups. She mentions there are many different ways to do it.

Then Sharon suggested her own grouping:  apple, carrot (and maybe tomato) as healthy snacks.  Sharon emphasized how they put things into different groups, and none was any better than another.  Then Sharon moved on to the main task; she'd give each group a paper with the list of ideas; they were to cut them out and then group them. She said all four students in the group need to agree on one grouping, and then they can glue them and give the group a name. She asked the class what to do if three students agree but one doesn't; she helps students with this, that they should explain their thinking and maybe some will change their mind. She goes over the directions carefully with the students, so they all know what steps they are supposed to do.

Sharon began Day 4 by projecting a list of the ideas, using a program that would allow her to move the ideas around. She asked the class to suggest how to group two ideas together, based on what their own group had discussed.

</p>
<p>Bianca suggested <em>blowing with your mouth</em> with <em>pop a ball</em> and the air will blow it under the title <em>things that are blowing</em>. Kasina grouped together <em>drop the car</em> and <em>let it fall down a hill</em> because in both cases the car is going downward. Alma then suggested adding <em>let it go down a ramp</em> to Kasina's list of two because in all three the car is dropping. Timmy said the three ideas couldn't go together because when the car is dropped, it would fall and stop, but with a ramp the car would go down and keep going. Tracy suggested combining three ideas: <em>wind could push it</em>, <em>put a fan on table and turn it on</em>, and <em>blow it with your mouth</em>, because they are all about wind and blowing.</p>


<p>Sharon then asked students to remain on the rug (floor) and to talk with neighbors (their group) about what they want to find out more about. Jewel wanted to use <em>firecracker</em>, <em>rocket</em> and <em>power booster</em>. Sharon asked the class if it would be safe to test those things at school. Most students did not raise their hands, so Sharon suggested those three be grouped in a category of things they could read about or think about but not actually try out in school. Bianca wanted to blow on the car (with her mouth), but she was wondering what would happen if the car was heavy. Timmy wanted to turn on a fan and let the car go; if the car is on a rug the car might go faster or it might go slower. Another student suggested that since the carpet is fluffy the car might go slower. Tracy wants to think about Fabian's hills to see if the car would actually go up the hills, since somebody thinks you need a power booster to get over hills. Timmy mentions that if a car is on a hill and you push it, it will go downhill faster. Aaron wants to know how a rubber band can shoot the car.
