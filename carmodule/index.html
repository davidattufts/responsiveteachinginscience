<p>Responsive teaching involves practices of attending and responding to the substance of students' thinking.  In a classroom where a teacher is responding to students' thinking, decisions about next moves are not made based on some pre-determined sequence of specific curricular objectives, but instead are made by assessing the merit of students' ideas as they naturally emerge in classroom discourse.  This means that curriculum materials that support responsive teaching cannot include a specific pathway that teachers must follow, as a sequence of ideas that need to be taught in a specific order.  Instead, each teacher's enactment will be unique, determined by what happens in his or her classroom. 
</p><p>
These responsive teaching resources were developed as part of our project on learning progressions in scientific inquiry.*  
</p>
<p>The responsive curriculum explored here is one in which students seek to understand how to make toy cars move.
</p>

<p>Responsive teaching places unique demands on curriculum. While the teacher may start with a set of goals and a sense of where things might go, the &lsquo;enacted&rsquo; curriculum emerges from the ideas students suggest and the next move decisions the teacher makes based on those ideas. At the start of an implementation of <em>toy cars, </em>students discuss various ways to make a toy car move. Over several subsequent class periods, this initial seeding of student ideas leads to discussions about motion, forces, and energy, driven by the students&rsquo; substantive engagement in scientific inquiry. In the Responsive Teaching Project, we have closely monitored several implementations of toy cars, and have found that, despite the contextual nature of the enacted curricula, students in all the classes share many common ideas, and they engage in similar kinds of classroom activity (although usually in different sequences). In this section of the website, we describe several such implementations, focusing in particular on the students&rsquo; ideas as they emerge and the next move decisions that the teachers make. In our responsive teaching in science project, <em>toy cars</em> was implemented in second-, third-, and fourth-grade classrooms.</p>
