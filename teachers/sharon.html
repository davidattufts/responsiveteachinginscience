<p>Sharon joined our project in the summer of 2009.  Before then, she had been teaching for six years, including one previous year in third grade.  Her school is a K-5 located in the inner city.  The entire school receives free lunch, 90% of the students are English Language Learners, with a diverse range of primary languages. Although, prior to joining our project, Sharon had received extensive professional development in mathematics and literacy as part of the school district's focus on those topics, she had little professional development in science.  Her first experience in our project was a two-week summer workshop in 2009, where she and twelve other project teachers engaged in their own scientific inquiry.  They also spent time identifying students' ideas and reasoning from classroom video clips, and discussing possible ways of responding to those ideas.  A few weeks after the workshop, she began teaching the toy car module, and her enactment of it is described in these resources.  Sharon is the co-author, along with Randy Bresser, of &quot;<em>Becoming Scientists: Inquiry-Based Teaching in Diverse Classrooms, Grades 3-5</em>,&quot; published by Stenhouse Publishers in 2013.  In the book, Sharon describes her experiences with responsive teaching. </p>
