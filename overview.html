<p>	
Responsive teaching refers to practices of attending and responding to the substance of students' thinking.  It begins with eliciting students' engagement around some launching question, or sometimes with discovering its spontaneous emergence.  From there, the teacher's role is to support that engagement and attend to it &mdash; watch and listen to the students' thinking, form a sense of what they are doing, and identify productive beginnings of scientific thinking.  In this way the teacher may select and pursue a more specific target in a manner that recognizes and builds on what students have begun.
</p>
<p>
These practices differ from conventional practices of lesson planning and curriculum development that give attention first to the established body of knowledge.  Designing a lesson means identifying some aspect of that body of knowledge that the designer expects students are ready to learn, and then organizing the experiences and instruction to guide students toward the target understanding.  Thus, the target for the lesson is selected in advance and reaching that target defines the success of the lesson.  In contrast, a responsive approach adapts plans and objectives within a particular lesson while still working toward larger learning goals.
</p>
<p>
Responsive teaching aligns with the essence of scientific practice. At the same time that children are learning science concepts, they are also learning about the kinds of activities that constitute science. Scientists work to figure out how phenomena in the natural world happen, i.e., they work to explain phenomena in terms of cause and effect. Explanations are always rooted in evidence and logical reasoning, and explaining the natural world frequently requires creativity and taking intellectual risks. In the process of developing explanations, scientists often develop models. Models are regularly based on the familiar, as the familiar can provide a starting place for new understandings. Sometimes more than one explanation or model for a phenomenon is proposed. Scientists use evidence and logical reasoning to determine which ones best account for the phenomenon. Sometimes this requires more experimentation. <em>A Framework for K-12 Science Education</em> (NRC, 2011) presents a comprehensive discussion of the practices of science.

<p>
Students' ability to pursue scientific practice is well supported. Research summarized in <em>Taking Science to School</em> (NRC, 2007) shows that kindergarteners already have sophisticated ways of thinking about the world, and in this pursuit children often engage in subtle and complex reasoning (Metz, 1995; Carey, 1985; Gelman and Biallargeon, 1983; Gelman and Kalish, 2005). </p>
<p>
Responsive teaching is gaining interest in the science education research community (Levin, Hammer, et al. 2009; Coffey, et al., 2011; Scherr, et al., 2011; Maskiewicz &amp; Winters, 2010; Maskiewicz &amp; Winters, 2012). Isolated examples of responsive teaching can be found in the literature, such as Deborah Ball's experiences in an elementary school math class (Ball, 1993). Coffey and her colleagues (Coffey, et. al., 2011) present an excellent overview of responsive teaching from the perspective of assessing students' ideas.
</p>
<p>
It is noteworthy that research literature supports the potential for responsive teaching to be particularly supportive of special needs learners. For example, numerous studies suggest that when science practice and language instruction are integrated, there is a positive impact on science learning, and the language and literacy development of English learners (Ku, Bravo &amp; Garcia, 2004; Lee, et al., 2008; Stoddart, et al., 2002).
</p>
<p>
There are a number of articles that describe variations of responsive teaching.  For some from this project, see Hammer, Goldberg &amp; Farguson (2012), Maskiewicz &amp; Winters (in press).  Responsive teaching is also discussed in Coffey, Hammer, Levin &amp; Grant (2011), Levin, Hammer, and Coffey (2009), Salter &amp; Atkins (2011), Scherr, Close &amp; McKagan (2011).  For closely related work in the literature, see Ball (1993), Duckworth (1986), Engle &amp; Conant (2002), Hammer (1997), Lampert (1990), and Schifter (1996).
