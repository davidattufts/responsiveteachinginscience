<p>For responsive teaching to be successful, certain social and socio-scientific norms need to be in place in the classroom (Yackel &amp; Cobb, 1996).  The classroom needs to be a place where students are comfortable expressing their own ideas, are attentive when others are speaking, and are comfortable agreeing or disagreeing with other students' ideas in a respectful way.  As the social norms are established, the teacher and the students can work on the socio-scientific norms that promote engagement in scientific argumentation (Driver, Newton &amp; Osborne, 2000).  </p>
<p>The RTS website has many examples where teachers are establishing and maintaining important social norms.  Below are some strategies that one of our teachers, Sharon Fargason, has used during her implementations of the Toy Cars module.  Following each of her comments, we provide the  appropriate video clip from the <em>Responsive Curricula</em> section of this website. </p>
<p>During Sharon Fargason's first day of her Fall 2010 implementation of Toy Cars, after asking students to think about all the ways they could make a toy car move, she had them first talk to their neighbors before sharing their ideas with the whole class.  This was her way of beginning to establish the norm that students are expected to develop and share their ideas. [Maybe click to reveal comment &amp; video clip.]<br /> </p>
<blockquote>

  <p><em>I chose to have the students talk to a partner since everyone was so eager to share.  Partner talks give students an opportunity to practice what they want to say before sharing it with the whole group. (Sharon, Year 2, Part 1, Day 1, video clip 1)</em><br>

<p>When students were ready to share their ideas publically, she made a big point of having students be attentive and listen carefully to what the other students were saying. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Since this was the very first time we had done science this year, I wanted to emphasize the need for my students to listen to each other.  I have found that, often, students are quiet while others are talking, but they are not truly listening to the substance of the ideas being shared.  This may be closely related to students' ideas of what science is.  Until now, most of these students have experienced science in a &quot;hands-on&quot; but teacher led manner.  That is, the students do an investigation or experiment, but it is usually the teacher's job (or the job of a textbook or video) to explain what has happened and to illuminate the science behind those ideas.  â€¨I wanted the students to know that we were doing something different.  I would not be explaining anything.  The students would be engaging with each other and critically evaluating the ideas heard.  I knew that this shift would not happen the first day and that much of this shift in thinking would happen as the students experienced science happening, but I wanted to make sure that the students started listening right away.  As students were talking, I affirmed students who took on an active listening role (turning to look at the speaker is active and implies that they are giving the speaker their full attention, whereas sitting quietly is less active).  (Sharon, Year 2, Part 1, Day 1, video clip 2)</em><br>

<p>Sharon points out that having students practice their speaking and listening skills is not something that happens only in science class, but throughout the day.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>It is important for me to work on class norms during science and also throughout the day. We practice speaking and listening skills throughout the day so that the students are able to use their skills during science time. I find that engaging with students in a morning meeting every day helps students practice listening to each other and helps them develop conversation skills, such as asking someone to speak up when you can't hear them.   (Sharon, Year 2, Part 1, Day 6, video clip 2)</em><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some students struggle at trying to explain their ideas to the class.  In those circumstances, the teacher can be helpful, not only to clarify what the student is saying, but also to model for others how they can be active listeners.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Isaac often liked to work by himself during science and wrote many ideas down in his science notebook. He often had interesting and mechanistic ideas to share, but he struggled with communicating his ideas clearly so others could understand him. I tried to make sure that I was always working hard to understand the substance of Isaac's ideas, and the class learned to do this also. Several students had questions for Isaac, showing that they were trying to understand Isaac's ideas. This is an important part of science in my classroom: that students learn to listen and really hear what others are saying. It is when they can do this that they can engage in real scientific conversations. (Sharon, Year 2, Part 1, Day 14, video clip 5)</em><br />&nbsp;</p>
