<p>

Much like <em><a href="../modules/watercycle/watercycle.html">the water cycle</a></em> and <em><a href="../carmodule/index.html">toy cars</a></em>, <em>electric circuits</em> is designed to engage students in substantive scientific inquiry. In <em>electric circuits</em>, students explore the properties of electric circuits and their individual components. Students are tasked with solving the following challenge:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>How
    can you get a bulb to light, with battery and wire?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the launching activity and follow-up activities, students focus not only on exploring ways to make a light bulb light, but also on explaining why it lights, how and why the individual components of the circuit work, and what passes between the circuit components (electricity, energy, <em>etc</em>.). Because <em>electric circuits</em> is a responsive curricula, what happens in the classroom depends on the ideas formulated by the students, and the instructor's &quot;next move&quot; decisions. In our responsive teaching in science project, <em>electric circuits</em> was implemented in fourth-grade classrooms.</p>
<p>In this section of the web site, we describe the first half of one teacher's (Kim's) implementation. Kim's <a href="trajectory.html">enacted trajectory</a> includes nodes (and links) for the launching activity and three subsequent activities.</p>
